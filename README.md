# Check-App
A checklist app created using Python &amp; Django with full CRUD functionality to manage upcoming tasks.

How the app was built:

- The general settings of this app was configured in the 'ChatApp' folder which is a Django App.
- The backend database creation and modelling was handled in the 'backend' folder which is another Django App.
- Function based views were used to handle POST requests from the frontend in views.py.
- Django.forms was used to create forms in which the user can enter information based on the categories highlighted in models.py.
- The frontend was inherited from the 'templates' folder which included the 'navbar.html' file and more importantly the 'main.html' file which
  served as the parent template file.
- Bootstrap was used to create a responsive design
